## Dataset
- This dataset, sourced from data.gov, captures attendance rates among public school students during the 2021-2022 academic year. With a focus on diverse student groups and districts, it serves as a key data source for my personal project, offering valuable insights into educational patterns and disparities.
- The identified student groups include those experiencing homelessness, students with disabilities, those eligible for free/reduced lunch, English learners, high needs students, non-high needs students, and students categorized by race/ethnicity.
